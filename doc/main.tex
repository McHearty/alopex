\Prog{Alopex} - A Tiny, Tabbed, Tiling Window Manager with Fur

\end{Name}

\section{Description}
\Prog{Alopex} is a tiny window manager written for core Xlib.

\section{Configuration}
\Prog{Alopex} is configured almost entirely at build-time through three header files:
\File{config.h}, 
\File{icons.h}, 
\File{themes.h}. 
For simplicity's sake, it is recommended to keep these files located in 
\File{\$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alopex} or
\File{\$HOME/.config/alopex}.

More information on each header file may be found at their respective pages:
\Cmd{alopex.config}{5},
\Cmd{alopex.icons}{5} and
\Cmd{alopex.themes}{5}.
