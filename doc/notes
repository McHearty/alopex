TAGS != WORKSPACES != VIEWS

CONTAINER CONCEPT ("overflow" filling)

STATUS FORMAT STRINGS
	%T	tags (icon + name)
	%t tags (name + icon)
	%n tags (name)
	%i tags (icon)
	%C clock (24 hour)
	%c clock (12 hour)
	%I key-chain input
	%1 first element of status input (delineated by '&')
	%2 second elements of status input 
	%3 ...

STATUS INPUT
	- Read one line at a time, but line is divided by '&'s into segments


THEMES
	- Each entry takes five floating point values
	- Entries are one of the following:
		- RGBA color plus one option (usually ignored)
		- X Y W H size offset values plus one option (eg Radius)
	- Offset values are added to the calculated space for the
		item.  Y and H values are inverted for bottom bars.
	- The last values of tab offset is the radius for the rounded
	  rectangle
	- The last value of tab focus background and stat background are used
	  to set the border width for all tabs and status bars
	- The last value of tab text entries are for text alignment:
		- Negative values are left aligned but padded by their value
		- 0.0-1.0 is a proporton of the space covered so 0.0 is left
		  aligned, 1.0 is right aligned, 0.5 is centered, etc.

WINDOW MARKS
	- 10 windows can be asigned to 'marks' 0-9.
	- Users should *not* assign windows to marks 0 or 1
		- 0 is the currently focused window
		- 1 is the previously focused window
		- 2 is used for all window based conditional tests in the macro
		  language
		- 3-9 are exclusively for user assignment

KEY CHAINING
	<concept ...>

KEYS
	[#]b(s|h|t|b|x)
		# = bar number (default = currently focused)
		s|h = show/hide
		t|b = top/bottom
		x   = toggle show/hide
	#t
		toggle visibility of tag #
	#T
		toggle window's presence on tag #
	#(s|S|x|X)
		show/hide exlusive/all-but tag #
	#(m|a|A)
		move/add/remove focused window to tag #
	v
		toggle view
	[#](;|:)(a-z)
		launch command/macro associated with string a-z # times
			w = firefox
			t = urxvt
			m = interrobang
	[#]j|k
		move focus up/down in stack # times
	h|l
		move focus to top/bottom of stack
	o
		foccus "other"
	[#]J|K
		move window up/down in stack # times
	H|L
		move window to top/bottom of stack
	[#]i|d
		increase/decrease master size by # steps
	[#]+|-
		increase/decrease nclients by #
	>|<
		nclients = 1/all
	[#]M
		Tile mode: rstack (default), bstack 1, monocle 2
	#(w|W)
		target = winmarks # / set winmarks #
	#g
		set gap size
	([#]q|Q)
		kill client (mark #) / quit
	R
		reconfigure
	ENTER | ESC
		return to normal mode (execute string on ENTER, ignore on ESC)

MACRO "LANGUAGE"
	- Macros, conditionals, and loops

STRINGS:
	- There are 127 user-definable strings (though the first 20 can't be
	  currently used).  These are represented by the associated
	  ascii-value character.  These are distinct from the bindings above.
	- Each string can hold a 'macro' or sequence of chain keys.
