- There may be issues with the cairo drawing functions used by alopex
  and some nvidia drivers.  Unfortunately I have no way of tracking down
  this issue.  If you have a nvidia card, either 1) use the FOSS
  drivers, 2) use another WM, and/or 3) help pinpoint if and where the
  issue lies between cairo and nvidia and report it to their devs.

- There is a known bug with gtk3 windows not being drawn.  This is next
  on my chopping block and a fix can be expected soon.
