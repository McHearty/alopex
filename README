TTWM is changing names to Alopex.

Please bear with me through the transition, there are a lot of 'housekeeping' steps to  coordinate here on github, on the webpage, forum discussion, AUR, and wiki (I'll leave that to H.G.).  Inevitably there will be days over the coming week where a failed coordination will lead to some bumps in the road.

This page will be updated when the change is complete.
