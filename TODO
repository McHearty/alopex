bug: titles sometimes disappear?
	- after running for some time
	- it seems bars stop being redrawn
	- observed only in monocle mode, test in stack modes:
		- check whether a new previously unused container will draw a new
		  bar
		- RESULT: new bars are drawn fine, only existing bars "freeze up"
			- Even when on an empty tag, still shows last tab
			- QUESTION: do bars stop drawing, or does buffer stop rendering
			  to bar windows?
		- SUSPECT: draw.c functions ?
		- FIX? So far I'm unable to replicate since adding the surface
		  flush on line 83 of tile.c --- this may solve it.
