bug: bars "freeze" and stop getting redrawn after some time
	- C->bar->buf is painted to C->win, but buf isn't updated.
	- only the buf in use at the time is affected
	- *very* rare - hard to replicate to learn more
floating/fullscreen windows:
	handle in map and configure events
icons
switch from configdb to config
